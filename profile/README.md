Welcome to RC Journey!

## Our Mission ##

At RC Journey, our mission is to empower and uplift formerly incarcerated individuals (_returned citizens_) by providing them with a platform to collaboratively build websites, cultivate valuable digital skills, and reshape their futures. We believe in the transformative power of technology and community to break down barriers, foster personal growth, and forge new paths toward success. Through our inclusive and supportive environment, we aim to harness the diverse talents of our members, enabling them to regain their confidence, reintegrate into society, and showcase their abilities. By fostering teamwork, creativity, and continuous learning, we are committed to redefining narratives, erasing stigmas, and demonstrating that everyone deserves a second chance to contribute meaningfully to the digital world.
